# Flutter Shopping App

A Flutter shopping app built from scratch as part of my learning journey.

## Features
- Product listing & detail pages
- Wishlist (Favorites) with persistent state
- Cart functionality
- Size & quantity selection
- Total price calculation
- Provider-based state management (Wishlist)
- Clean UI & UX

## Tech Stack
- Flutter
- Dart
- Provider (State Management)

## Learning Journey
Started with a Currency Converter app, then a Weather app.
Instead of following a tutorial for this shopping app, I built it independently to test my understanding.

## Current Status
Wishlist state is centralized using Provider.
Cart state is currently managed using local state (`setState`).
Next step: refactor cart to Provider.
